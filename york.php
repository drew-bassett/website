        I am currently studying for a MSc Computer Science with Cyber Security at the University of York. This is a part-time, online degree that I am doing whilst I work full-time.

    <h3>Some of My Work</h3>
<p><b>Module 1 - Algorithms and Data Structures</b><br />
I made a simple shopping list program in Java; the below GIF demonstrates the program as well as some error handling. The source code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/missdrewbaxter/ShoppingList" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. <br/><br/>
