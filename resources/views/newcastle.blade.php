        In 2013 to 2016 I studied BSc Mathematics at Newcastle University, graduating with a First-class Honors degree. I am very proud of my degree as I achieved it whilst commuting 3 hours a day by bus to campus and working part-time at the weekends. I have since passed my driving test and have got a lovely blue Hyundai i10!

        In my second year, I was lucky enough to earn a research scholarship to work along side a lecturer to study the magnetic fields in neutron stars.</p>

        In my third year, I specialised in applied mathematics. I also studied a module called Mathematical Education, which looked at theories and issues in mathematical education. My degree did not involve a dissertation; instead we did a group project module.
