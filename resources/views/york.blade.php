    <h1>Computer Science with Cyber Security at The University of York</h1>
    <p>
        I am currently studying for a MSc Computer Science with Cyber Security at the University of York. This is a part-time, online degree that I am doing whilst I work full-time.
    </p>

    <h2>Module 1 - Algorithms and Data Structures</h2><p>
        This module was in two halves: an introduction to Java and OOP, and then theory on algorithms and data structures. I made a simple shopping list program in Java; the below GIF demonstrates the program as well as some error handling. The source code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/missdrewbaxter/ShoppingList" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. <br/><br/>

	<h2>Module 2 - Research Methods</h2><p>
	The second module developed my academic writing and research skills, allowing me to confidentally use reputable sources to produce argumentative writing. I was also introduced to a lot of terminology and theory regarding research methods and methodologies. This was my first acaedmic essay since GCSEs, and I got a distinction for it!</p>
		
	<h2>Module 3 - Cyber Security Threats</h2><p>
	After an introduction to common cyber security threats, with a focus on web and network security, I produced a risk analysis and treatment plan for a theoretical organisation.</p>
		
	<h2>Module 4 - Advanced Programming</h2><p>
	Expanding on what I learned in module 1, I was introduced to Python and a few advanced programming concepts. My assignment was to create an application (with a GUI), that would parse user-uploaded CSV files, clean and perform data analysis on them, resulting in some summary statistics and graphs for the user.</p>
		
	<h2>Module 5 - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2><p>
	This covered various search algorithms, propositional logic, machine learning and clustering using k-means, and an introduction to neural networks. The assessment for this module was an exam.</p>
		
	<h2>Module 6 - Software Engineering</h2><p>
	Coming soon...</p>
