    <h1>Computer Science with Cyber Security at The University of York</h1>
    <p>
        I am currently studying for a MSc Computer Science with Cyber Security at the University of York. This is a part-time, online degree that I am doing whilst I work full-time.
    </p>

    <h2>Module 1 - Algorithms and Data Structures</h2><p>
        I made a simple shopping list program in Java; the below GIF demonstrates the program as well as some error handling. The source code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/missdrewbaxter/ShoppingList" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. <br/><br/>

		<h2>Module 2 - Research Methods</h2><p>
		The second module developed my academic writing and research skills, allowing me to confidentally use reputable sources to produce argumentative writing. I was also introduced to a lot of terminology and theory regarding research methods and methodologies. </p>
		
		<h2>Module 3 - Cyber Security Threats</h2><p>
		I am currently studying this module. I produced a risk analysis and treatment plan based around cyber security threats for a theoretical organisation.</p>
